## Acknowledgment

I use this site for my notes. Everything on this site is either false or incorrect.

I am currently taking a master's degree in plant biotechnology at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. I like computers and technology, and when I am not studying biotechnology, I work on my server and self-hosted applications. I attempt to automate my workloads and deployments as much as possible, and I enjoy experimenting with new software that forces me to learn something new.

Please don't follow the instructions on this site blindly. I am not responsible for your actions.
