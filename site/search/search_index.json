Additionally, you can use <code>pip freeze</code> to create a lockfile, so builds are reproducible at all times:</p> <pre><code>pip freeze &gt; requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Now, the lockfile can be used for installation:</p> <pre><code>pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>This will automatically install compatible versions of all dependencies: MkDocs, Markdown, Pygments and Python Markdown Extensions.
